# Ad 1 — “Breakthrough” (60s)

**Goal:** Stop-scroll hook + agitate problem + preview transformation + CTA to Day-1 access.

## Script (VO/A-roll)
1) **Hook (0–5s)**  
   “If getting high-ticket clients feels random right now, this will be the 60 seconds that changes your pipeline.”

2) **Qualify (5–10s)**  
   “I help coaches and small agencies get consistent clients using simple YouTube funnels—no big budget, no guesswork.”

3) **Pain (10–20s)**  
   “Most people copy Instagram tactics to YouTube, burn cash, and still depend on referrals.”

4) **Promise (20–30s)**  
   “The Foundation shows you exactly how to launch one YouTube campaign that predictably books calls.”

5) **Proof Bridge (30–45s)**  
   “Inside you’ll copy the targeting we use, paste our UTMs, and publish two ads. Students report their first booked calls within 7–14 days.”

6) **CTA (45–60s)**  
   “Click to unlock **Day-1** now. You’ll get the plan, the scripts, and the exact tracking so you know what’s working.”

## On-screen
- Subtitles on, bold keywords (Clients, Targeting, Day-1 Access)
- End-card: “Unlock Day-1 → agency.risetothrive-academy.com”

## Variants
- Hook swaps: “If your calendar’s full of no-shows…”, “Still relying on referrals?”
- Cut to 30s by trimming Pain + Proof to one line each.
