# Ad 2 — “Proof + Offer” (60s, Warm)

**Goal:** Social proof + what’s included + low-friction CTA for warm audiences.

## Script
1) **Credibility (0–8s)**  
   “You watched the plan—here’s what students are seeing.”

2) **Proof (8–25s)**  
   “Ben launched with 2 ads, 1 campaign—booked 6 calls in his first 9 days.”

3) **Offer (25–45s)**  
   “Day-1 gives you: campaign shell, 2 ready scripts, Pictory prompts, and UTM tracker so your data’s clean.”

4) **CTA (45–60s)**  
   “Ready? Unlock Day-1 now. If you’re not setting calls in two weeks, pause it—no hard feelings.”
