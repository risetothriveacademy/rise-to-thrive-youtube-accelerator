# Foundation Course — YouTube Ads Campaign Plan

## 1) Goal
Drive qualified traffic to the Foundation Course landing page and convert purchases at or below target CPA while building a warm audience for retargeting and future offers.

- Primary KPI: CPA (Purchase)
- Secondary KPIs: CTR, CPC, View Rate, Add-to-Cart, Email Captures
- Daily Start Budget: $50–$100 (scale on CPA/ROAS)

## 2) Core Offer
- Product: Foundation Course
- Price: $99 (confirm)
- Main Promise: Launch your client-acquisition system quickly and simply.

## 3) Destination
- Landing page: https://foundation.risetothrive-academy.com/offer-video-a
- Success page: https://foundation.risetothrive-academy.com/success
- UTM: see `ads/youtube/utm-cheat-sheet.md`

## 4) Audiences (initial)
- In-market/affinity: coaching, consulting, agency, small business marketing
- Custom segments (keywords below)
- Remarketing (when available): site visitors, video viewers (25%+ / 50%+), checkout abandoners

## 5) Keyword / Topic Seed List (use for Custom Segments & video placements)
- "start marketing agency"
- "high ticket coaching clients"
- "get clients with YouTube"
- "set up funnels fast"
- "course launch ads"
- "facebook ads for coaches"
- "youtube ads for coaches"
- "client acquisition systems"

> Tip: Build **Custom segment: People who searched for any of these terms** (last 7–30 days). Also use as **topics** and **content targeting** where relevant.

## 6) Creative Angles (match to ad groups)
- Breakthrough / before→after transformation
- Proof & offer (social proof, outcomes, time saved)
- “Simple System” (no tech overwhelm)
- Fast start (Day-1 access, immediate result)

## 7) Hooks (for 5–15s openings)
- “Coaches: stuck without consistent clients?”
- “I built a simple client-acquisition system you can set up this week.”
- “Stop burning on complex funnels — copy my Foundation setup.”
- “If you can spare 60 minutes today, you can launch this system.”

## 8) CTAs
- “Start Foundation now”
- “Get Day-1 access”
- “Unlock the client-acquisition system”

## 9) Ad Group Structure (suggested)
- **AG1 — Breakthrough** → Ad1 breakthrough script + matching thumbnail
- **AG2 — Proof/Offer** → Ad2 proof/offer script + matching thumbnail
- **AG3 — Simple System** → (optional third variant)
- **AG4 — Remarketing** → Short direct-offer versions

## 10) Budgets
- Split evenly across AG1/AG2 to start; move budget to winner after 48–72h if significance is clear.
